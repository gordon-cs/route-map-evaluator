# cps222p5-test-data

This repo provides sample input and output files for testing your
Project 5 code.  Much more test data is needed to ensure your
code works. Remember: **if you haven't tested it, it doesn't work.**

* .in: sample input
* .out: expected output for matching input.  Please match the format of each line exactly, by comparing your output to this with the "diff" command.  Try to make the output line order match, too.  But if you are confident your code is producing correct output in a different valid order, that is acceptable.

There is also a .jpg image of a diagram of some input.
